  "parameterExplanation": {
    "soilMoisture": "Current soil moisture levels show some fluctuations. After a period of drought, there is now a moderate moisture level. This is essential for strawberry plants, which thrive in well-moistened soil.",
    "temperature": "The temperature is stable and suitable for strawberries, averaging above 25Â°C, which is ideal for their growth.",
    "windSpeed": "The wind speeds are moderate, typically around 3-4 m/s, which is manageable for strawberry plants; they don't flourish in very windy conditions.",
    "windDirection": "Predominantly coming from the east, which is fairly stable. This direction does not pose a threat to strawberry cultivation.",
    "humidity": "Humidity levels have varied but are mostly in the comfortable range around 70-80%. High humidity helps strawberries but excessive moisture can lead to diseases."

  "bestCropsToPlant": [
    {
      "plantName": "Raspberries",
      "explanation": "Similar to strawberries, raspberries enjoy similar growing conditions and can thrive in the same types of soil."
    },
    {
      "plantName": "Blueberries",
      "explanation": "They also thrive in acidic soil and benefit from similar moisture levels as strawberries."
    },
    {
      "plantName": "Tomatoes",
      "explanation": "They can adapt to similar climatic conditions and require moderate moisture, just like strawberries."

  "MyCropsExplanation": {
    "summary": "Strawberries are a good crop to plant given the current conditions in your area. Make sure to manage water levels to keep the soil moist but not too wet.",
    "details": [
      "Strawberries require well-drained soil with plenty of organic matter.",
      "Water regularly but avoid waterlogging.",
      "Mulching can help retain moisture and suppress weeds."

    "pests": [
      {
        "pestsName": "Aphids",
        "explanation": "These small insects suck the sap from strawberry plants, weakening them and potentially transmitting diseases."
      },
      {
        "pestsName": "Spider Mites",
        "explanation": "They thrive in hot, dry conditions, so monitor moisture levels to prevent infestations."

    "weeds": [
      {
        "weedsName": "Crabgrass",
        "explanation": "A common weed that competes with strawberry plants for nutrients and moisture."
      },
      {
        "weedsName": "Dandelions",
        "explanation": "They can spread quickly and inhibit the growth of strawberries by competing for resources."
